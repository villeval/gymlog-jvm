# gymlog

Simple Spring Boot -application to provide REST APIs for front-end and mobile development training. The application is containerized with Docker for actual use but it can be run locally 
with "gradle bootRun" -command and it will be found from localhost:8081. Included deploy-scripts are for AWS-based development environment (CI/CD-pipeline built with Jenkins) to automate the build and deploy steps.

Nginx configs for proxy are found in separate repository.
