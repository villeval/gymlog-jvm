# Gymlog

### Notes for deployment
- The application expects that there are three environment variables present upon deployment: ENV_CONFIG, ENC_ALGORITHM and ENC_PASSWORD. These can be given when running the Docker image.
- Enable logging to file, mount log directory from container to host and configure logging to needed level

### TODO:
- new front-end (for example Vue.js-based) or modifying and using the implementation from gymlog-js-project
